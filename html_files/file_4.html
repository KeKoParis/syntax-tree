This book is a comprehensive introduction to text forming resources in English, along with practical procedures for
analysing English texts and relating them to their contexts of use. It has been designed to complement functional
grammars of English, building on the generation of discourse analysis inspired by Halliday and Hasan's Cohesion in
English. The analyses presented were developed within three main theoretical and applied contexts: (i) educational
linguistics (especially genre-based literacy programmes) (ii) critical linguistics (as manifested in the development of
social semiotics) and (iii) computational linguistics (in dialogue with the various text generation projects based on
systemic approaches to grammar and discourse). English Text's major contribution is to outline one way in which a rich
semantically oriented functional grammar can be systematically related to a theory of discourse semantics, including
deconstruction of contextual issues (i.e. register, genre and ideology). The chapters have been organized with the needs
of undergraduate students in theoretical linguistics and postgraduate students in applied linguistics in mind.
