    I went from London to Prague to set up a new regional office there. You know I'd always wanted to go, but maybe I
    was imagining Prague in spring when I used to talk about that. Winter was really hard, with minus 15 degrees in the
    mornings and dark really early in the evening. But at least it was blue skies and white snow and not days on end of
    grey skies and rain, like at home. It's tough being away from home over Christmas, though, and Skype on Christmas
    Day wasn't really the same as being with everyone.
